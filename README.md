Inkubator is a web application that helps users find inspiration for their next tattoo while supporting artists directly. The user can discover new tattoo designs based on 
keyword searches, bookmark their favorites, and view them on their dashboard. Artists are also able to showcase their work by uploading their designs on their dashboard and 
attaching descriptive keywords so potential new clients can find them. The purpose of Inkubator is to simplify the process of exploring tattoo ideas and to organise them in 
one place while also championing artists and their original work.``
### Features
Inkubator includes a client and artist registration system with PHP sessions and a personalized dashboard. An explore tattoos option is also available for guests that are not 
logged in. There are separate login and registration buttons for the client and artist. The client’s dashboard features a navigation bar with the option to “Find Your Next Ink”. 
The “Find Your Next Ink” link directs the client to a search bar where they can use key words, such as “floral” or “fine line”, to search through the designs uploaded to the site 
by the artists. The search matches up with the key words that are uploaded by the artist. They are then given the option to bookmark their favorites. The bookmarked designs will 
populate on their dashboard and they have the option to remove tattoos from their bookmark. The artist’s dashboard features an area to upload their tattoo flash designs. The artist 
can upload an image along with key words to help the designs be found by the users. The uploaded designs can be seen at the bottom of their dashboard. They also have the option to 
“Browse Uploaded Designs” to look at the system from the user’s perspective or get inspiration themselves.
### Testing
To see how this application works we have created an artist user and a client user for you to test the functionality. Just follow [this link](http://inkubator.thsite.top/index.html) and enter either of the credentials below at the login.

If you would like to view the application from the perspective of the **client** use:

If you would like to view the application from the perspective of the **artist** use:

### Future Work
Inkubator is currently a working prototype but future development would include a messaging capability so clients can contact artists they find if they’re interested in getting work 
done by them. An additional feature would include an artist’s ability to create a customizable profile to better advertise their business and portfolio, including links to their other 
social media or website. Also, both clients and artists may one day group their saved or uploaded designs into collections for better organization.
