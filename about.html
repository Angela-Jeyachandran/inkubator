        <p><b>Inkubator</b> is a web application that helps users find inspiration for 
            their next tattoo while supporting artists directly. The user can 
            discover new tattoo designs based on keyword searches, bookmark their 
            favorites, and view them on their dashboard. Artists are also able to 
            showcase their work by uploading their designs on their dashboard and 
            attaching descriptive keywords so potential new clients can find them. 
            The purpose of Inkubator is to simplify the process of exploring tattoo 
            ideas and to organise them in one place while also championing artists 
            and their original work.

            <h3>Features</h3>
            Inkubator includes a client and artist registration system with PHP 
            sessions and a personalized dashboard. An explore tattoos option is also 
            available for guests that are not logged in. There are separate login and 
            registration buttons for the client and artist. The client’s dashboard 
            features a navigation bar with the option to “Find Your Next Ink”. The 
            “Find Your Next Ink” link directs the client to a search bar where they can
            use key words, such as “floral” or “fine line”, to search through the 
            designs uploaded to the site by the artists. The search matches up with 
            the key words that are uploaded by the artist. They are then given the 
            option to bookmark their favorites. The bookmarked designs will populate on 
            their dashboard and they have the option to remove tattoos from their 
            bookmark. The artist’s dashboard features an area to upload their tattoo 
            flash designs. The artist can upload an image along with key words to help 
            the designs be found by the users. The uploaded designs can be seen at the 
            bottom of their dashboard. They also have the option to “Browse Uploaded 
            Designs” to look at the system from the user’s perspective or get inspiration 
            themselves.

            <h3>Development Process</h3>
            Inkubator’s development process began with a wireframe designed in Figma 
            to guide our vision and to create a starting point for the website’s 
            identity. A <a href="https://github.com/Angela-Jeyachandran/inkubator/tree/main" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> 
            was then set up and used for version control and collaboration. This helped manage 
            changes, track progress, and maintain backups throughout the development process. 
            The project was built in Visual Studio Code with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the 
            design and functionality and JSON for storing data. The backend uses PHP sessions 
            to maintain login states and ensure each account type has access to the correct features. 
            It was then tested to check for all user pathways and later transferred to 
            TinkerHost for web hosting. 
            <br><br><br>
            <h3>Data and Storage</h3>
            The client credentials, artist accounts, and bookmarks are stored in JSON 
            files such as users.json and bookmarks.json. Each user or artist has their 
            own profile which is indicated by their “role”. The “role” of either “artist” 
            or “client” changes their dashboard. For the tattoo uploads, flat files are 
            used to store images directly in the server’s directory. This allows artists 
            to upload and view their own designs on their dashboard.
            <br><br><br>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            Some of the initial challenges included deciding on the “look” and identity 
            of the web application. Brainstorming sessions took place over a week using 
            Figma and Pinterest. Another challenge was wrestling with the logic and 
            sometimes total gaps of knowledge with using PHP.
            <br><br><br>
            <h3>Future Work</h3>
            Inkubator is currently a working prototype but future development would 
            include a messaging capability so clients can contact artists they find if 
            they’re interested in getting work done by them. An additional feature would 
            include an artist’s ability to create a customizable profile to better advertise 
            their business and portfolio, including links to their other social media or 
            website. Also, both clients and artists may one day group their saved or uploaded 
            designs into collections for better organization. 
            <br><br><br>
            <h3>Testing</h3>
            To see how this application works we have created an artist user and a client user 
            for you to test the functionality. 
            <br><br>
            If you would like to view the application from the perspective of the <b>client</b> 
            use:
            <br>
            <span class="highlight">
                <b>Username</b>: <i>client</i>
                <br>
                <b>Password</b>: <i>client</i>
            </span>
            <br><br>
            If you would like to view the application from the perspective of the <b>artist</b> use:
            <br>
            <span class="highlight">
                <b>Username</b>: <i>artist</i>
                <br>
                <b>Password</b>: <i>artist</i>
            </span>
            <br><br><br>
